# First project: A project who's main purpose is to be the first. any further revisions will have to be in a different project, as revising the first project would cause it to no longer be the first project. Git will be utilized to store the first project, however there will be no further versions of the first project to control or otherwise manage, as building upon the first project would make it no longer the first project.
